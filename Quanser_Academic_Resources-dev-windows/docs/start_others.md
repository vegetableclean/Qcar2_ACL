# Getting Started With Quanser's Other Products

This guide walks you through getting started with the following products: 

- [Qube-Servo 3](#qube-servo-3)
- [Aero 2](#aero-2)
- [QArm](#qarm)


If  your product is not listed above, use the [Getting Started - Labs](start_labs.md) guide. 

## Teaching Content

These products have full teaching curriculum. Each of their labs consists of the following documentation:

- **Concept Reviews**: 
    Independent reference material for student use that serves as a means for them to refresh the most important concepts and equations for any lab. These exist mostly in a separate concept_reviews folder in the Quanser folder or could be placed alongside the lab. 
- **Application Guides**: 
    Lab specific introduction that guides students towards why the lab is important and what they will learn as well as things they need to know before starting the lab. 
- **Lab Procedures**:
    Lab specific instruction manuals with guided steps to walk students through the lab, reflect on important considerations and take notes or screenshots and capture results.
- **Recommended Assessments**:
    Lab specific take home questionnaire that requires critical thinking and further analysis of lab results. The results from the lab procedure will be analyzed here by the student.
