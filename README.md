# ACL QCar Testbed

A repository for building and maintaining a reproducible autonomous-vehicle testbed in the **Autonomic Computing Lab (ACL), University of Arizona**. The testbed supports rapid experimentation, teaching, and demos on Quanser QCar platforms.



---

## Goals
- Provide a **reliable, reusable codebase** validated on ACL‚Äôs hardware.
- Enable **sensor fusion, perception, control, and V2V/V2I** experiments.
- Keep setup steps **documented and automatable** so new members can get started quickly.

---

## Testbed Hardware (Current)
- **QCar 2** √ó 2 units
- **QCar (Gen-1)** √ó 2 unit
- **Miniature road map / track**
- **Traffic lights & road signs** (scaled)

### üìÑ Installation (Windows PC)
1. Unzip the package(s) above. Open the folder and **read `readme_user.txt`** for details on Simulink and/or Python configurations.
2. Run the following batch files **in order**:
   - `step_1_select_resources.bat` ‚Äî choose which resources to use
   - `step_2_download_resources_instructor.bat` ‚Äî download the selected packages
3. Navigate to `Documents\Quanser\1_setup` and run:
   - `configure_matlab.bat`
   - `configure_python.bat`
4. **Restart your PC** to apply environment-variable updates.

**Troubleshooting:** If you hit errors, capture the console output and open an issue with your OS version, MATLAB version, and Python version.
